# Note

## Data Preprocessing
1. Denoising
    - High-frequency noise (>40hz).
    - Baseline wander (<0.5hz).
2. Inversion correction
    - If the signal is inverted, correct it.
3. Downsampling
    - From 300hz to 120hz.
4. Data Length Standardization 
    - Target time is 30sec
    - Target length is 3600 (Target time * resampled frequency)
    - If signal lenght > Target length
        - Discard the redundant signal.
    - If signal lenght < Target length 
        - Duplicate the signal until it reaches the required length.
    - If signal lenght = Target length
        - Do nothing.

## Spilt Dataset
1. Split the dataset into `Train`, `Valid`, and `Test` sets.
    - Train : Valid : Test = 80 : 10 : 10
2. For federated learning
    - Further split the `Train` set equally among each client (called `Client_N` set).
    - Each client then splits its portion into `Client_Train_N` and `Client_Valid_N` set.
        - Client_Train_N : Client_Valid_N = 90 : 10
